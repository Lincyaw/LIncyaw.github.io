    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen) and am currently an MPhil candidate in Software Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK(SZ)) and fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/).

My research centers on software testing, with a special focus on fuzz testing as well as AIops. I’m dedicated to advancing software reliability, security and observerability through innovative testing and monitoring methodologies. I warmly welcome collaborations and discussions in this domain.
