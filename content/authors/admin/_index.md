## About Me

I graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen) and am currently a PhD student in Software Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK(SZ)) and fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/).

My research centers on software testing, with a special focus on fuzz testing as well as AIops. I’m dedicated to advancing software reliability, security and observerability through innovative testing and monitoring methodologies. I warmly welcome collaborations and discussions in this domain.
